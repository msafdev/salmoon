        <p>
          Iâ€™m Salman, a fullstack software engineer with almost 2 years of
          experience. I build user-centric products through creative development
          and seamless interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passionate about both the technical and artistic side of thing, I
          strive to create digital experiences that have meaning to each of
          their iteration.

      <Paragraph title="Where it all started" from="2020" to="2023">
        <p>
          I started programming from when I entered my college, Diponegoro
          University . Back then, I used to be so anxious deciding my path,
          trying Java, Python, C++, and even ASM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I found something that I really love: website development. I
          started to learn HTML, CSS, JS, and ofc React. I also learned how to
          build a simple server using Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was very hard for someone who never touched programming before, as
          there are no production-ready AIs to co-write code with me. So I had
          to learn everything from scratch.
        </p>

      <Paragraph title="Present time" from="2024" to="present">
        <p>
          Fast forward to today, I have been working as a fullstack software,
          settling on Next.js, Tailwind, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL as my main
          stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my new-found knowledge, I started to build a lot of projects,
          some are personal, some are for clients. I also started to write quite
          a few of articles about anything in general, but mostly about tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I am continuing to learn new things, and I am excited to see what
          the AI-pocalypse will bring to me in the future.
