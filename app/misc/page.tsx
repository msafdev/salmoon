          Iâ€™m Salman, a fullstack software engineer based in <span className="text-foreground">Jakarta, Indonesia</span>.
          Building user-centric prodcuts through creative development and
          seamless interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passionate about both the technical and artistic side of thing, I
          strive to create digital experiences that have meaning to each of
          their iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          My products are driven by quality and passion. By merging creativity
          with technical skill, I aim to build applications that make every
          interaction be remembered by everyone.

      <Paragraph title="Where it all started." from="2020" to="2023">
        <p>
          I started programming from when I entered my college. Back then, I
          used to be so anxious deciding my path, trying Java, Python, C++, and
          even ASM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I found something that I really love: web development. I started
          to learn HTML, CSS, JS, then React. I also learned how to build a
          simple server using Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was very hard for someone who never touched programming before, as
          there are no production-ready AIs to co-write code with me. So I had
          to learn everything from scratch.
        </p>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph title="Present time." from="2024" to="present">
        <p>
          Fast forward to today, I have been working as a fullstack software,
          settling on Next.js, Tailwind, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL as my main
          stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my new-found knowledge, I started to build a lot of projects,
          some are personal, some are for clients. I also started to write quite
          a few of articles about anything in general, but mostly about tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I am continuing to learn new things, and I am excited to see what
          the AI apocalypse will bring to me in the future.
