## Introduction

Next.js is a React framework for building scalable, high-performance web applications. It offers features like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and more — all with a great developer experience.

In this guide, you'll learn:

- System requirements
- How to install and scaffold a Next.js app
- The difference between the `app/` and `pages/` directories
- How to run your development server

---

## System Requirements

Before starting, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js** version `18.17` or higher
- **npm**, `pnpm`, or `yarn`
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code

To verify you have Node.js and npm installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If needed, install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

---

## Installation

To create a new Next.js project, use the official `create-next-app` CLI:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

The CLI will ask you a few questions:

- JavaScript or TypeScript
- App Router (`app/`) or Pages Router (`pages/`)
- Whether to include Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and other options

Navigate into your new project folder:

```bash
cd my-next-app
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## App vs Pages Directory

Next.js supports two routing paradigms:

### Pages Directory

The original routing system.

- File-based routing
- `pages/index.tsx` maps to `/`
- Supports API routes (`pages/api/`)
- Client components by default
- Manual layout management

### App Directory

Introduced as the App Router in Next.js 13 and stabilized in 13.4.

- File-based routing with nested folders
- Native support for layouts (`layout.tsx`)
- Server components enabled by default
- Supports loading and error states
- Recommended for new projects

| Feature           | `pages/` directory    | `app/` directory           |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Routing system    | File-based            | File-based                 |
| Server components | Not supported         | Supported                  |
| Layouts           | Manual via `_app.tsx` | Nested, built-in           |
| Loading UI        | Not built-in          | Built-in via `loading.tsx` |
| Error handling    | Custom `_error.tsx`   | Built-in via `error.tsx`   |
| Recommended for   | Legacy/simple apps    | New applications           |

> For new projects, the `app/` directory is recommended for its flexibility and modern features.

## Project Structure

When using the `app/` directory, your project might look like this:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── about/
│       └── page.tsx
├── public/
├── styles/
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
```

Each folder under `app/` defines a route. You can also add:

- `layout.tsx` - for nested layouts
- `loading.tsx` - for loading UI during route transitions
- `error.tsx` - for route-specific error handling

---

## Next Steps

Once your project is running, here are a few things you can do:

- Add Tailwind CSS: `npx tailwindcss init -p`
- Create dynamic routes using file-based syntax (e.g. `[slug].tsx`, `[...slug].tsx`)
- Learn about route handlers (or API routes if you're using `pages/` dir)
- Deploy your site using [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Summary

Next.js offers two routing systems with different capabilities. The `app/` directory unlocks powerful features like server components and nested layouts, while the `pages/` directory provides a stable, familiar structure for simpler apps. Either way, you're building on a strong, modern React foundation.
