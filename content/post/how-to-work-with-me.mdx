## Introduction

We are complex creatures. It takes a long time to understand ourselves. Even today, there are still parts of ourselves that function beyond our control and remain difficult to comprehend.

It's quite strange, isn't it? We often expect others to understand us, while we rarely take the initiative to inform them about ourselves.

This writing represents the ideal version of myself. Unfortunately, I am not always in that ideal state. Regardless, I continuously strive toward it.

As I evolve, so will this writing. It will never be finished and will always be updated to reflect my current state.

## Communication Guidelines

### 1. Be Direct

Please **state your purpose directly**. I may be busy and not in the mood for small talk. A clear and concise message helps me respond quickly and efficiently.

This saves time for both of us and maybe for the entire human race.

### 2. Reach Out Anytime

You are welcome to contact me **at any time**, even late at night.  
However, please understand that I am not in front of the screen 24/7. I have other responsibilities, and messages will be answered when I have free time.

For formal matters, **business hours** are the most reliable time to contact me.

### 3. Follow Up

If your message hasn't received a reply after some time, feel free to **follow up**.

I'm not great at multitasking, and sometimes messages get missed or forgotten.

### 4. Permission Required

Please **ask for permission** before adding my name to any list. This allows me to make thoughtful decisions.
