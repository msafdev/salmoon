## Rehype Pretty Code

[`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) is a Rehype plugin powered by the
[`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) syntax highlighter that provides beautiful code blocks for Markdown or MDX. It works on both the server at build-time (avoiding runtime syntax highlighting) and on the client for dynamic highlighting.

## Editor-Grade Highlighting

  Enjoy the accuracy and granularity of VS Code's syntax highlighting engine and
  the popularity of its themes ecosystem â€” use any VS Code theme you want!
</span>

## Line Numbers and Line Highlighting

You can highlight specific lines or words using `[!code highlight]`, track diffs using `[!code ++]` and `[!code --]`, and even highlight a word using `[!code word:"refs"]`

```ts
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating(); // [!code highlight]

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={refs.setReference} /> /* [!code highlight:2] */
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  );
}
```

---

```py
import math

radius = 2 # [!code --]
radius = 5 # [!code ++]
area = math.pi * radius**2
print(f"The area of the circle is: {area}")
```

---

```bash
npm install rehype-pretty-code
```
