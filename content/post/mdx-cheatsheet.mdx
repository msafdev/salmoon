## What is MDX?

**MDX** lets you write JSX in Markdown. It blends the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. You can embed custom UI, interactivity, and dynamic content directly inside your `.mdx` files.

MDX is great for:

- Documentation
- Developer blogs
- Component previews
- Interactive examples

---

## Basic Syntax

MDX supports standard Markdown:

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

- Lists
- Like
- These

**Bold**, _Italic_, and `Inline code`

> Blockquotes work too
```

---

## Frontmatter

MDX supports YAML frontmatter at the top of the file for metadata:

```yaml
---
title: My Post
description: This is a description.
tags: ["mdx", "blog"]
published: true
date: 2025-07-16
---
```

This is often used in blogs or documentation systems to generate pages with dynamic content.

## Rehype Pretty Code

[`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) is a Rehype plugin powered by [`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki). It enables syntax highlighting at **build time**, resulting in faster page loads and consistent styles across themes.

```bash
npm install rehype-pretty-code
```

### Features

- VS Code theme support (dark/light mode aware)
- Line highlighting and line numbers
- Word-level highlights
- Diff indicators (`++`, `--`)

### Code Highlights

```tsx
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating(); // [!code highlight]

  return (
    <>
      // [!code highlight:2]
      <div ref={refs.setReference} />
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Code Diffs

```py
radius = 2 # [!code --]
radius = 5 # [!code ++]
area = math.pi * radius**2
print(area)
```

### Word Highlights

```js
// [!code word:console:2]
console.log("1");
console.log("2");
console.log("3");
console.log("4");
```

## Code Block Annotations

With `rehype-pretty-code`, you can annotate code in several ways:

| Syntax                | Effect                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `[!code highlight]`   | Highlights a line                 |
| `[!code highlight:n]` | Highlights a line in range(n)     |
| `[!code ++]`          | Shows as added in diff mode       |
| `[!code --]`          | Shows as removed in diff mode     |
| `[!code word:X]`      | Highlights the word X             |
| `[!code word:X:n]`    | Highlights the word X in range(n) |

You can also combine multiple annotations into 1 (one).

---

## Custom Components

MDX allows embedding React components directly:

```mdx
import Alert from "@/components/Alert";

<Alert type="info">This is an info alert with **markdown** inside!</Alert>
```

Use this to create reusable UI for documentation:

- `Note`, `Warning`, `Callout`
- `Tabs`, `Accordion`, `VideoPlayer`, etc.
- Interactive playgrounds with live code

---

## Custom Styling

Tailwind CSS or any other CSS framework can be applied by wrapping content in styled components or using `prose` classes.

Example with a custom `Note`:

```mdx
<Note title="Heads up!">
  You can use `rehype-pretty-code` for beautiful code blocks.
</Note>
```

Or wrap content with Tailwind's typography styles:

```jsx
<div className="prose prose-zinc dark:prose-invert">{children}</div>
```

---

## Embedding Media

You can embed images, iframes, and videos like normal HTML:

```mdx
<img src="/images/demo.png" alt="Demo" width="600" />

<iframe
  allow="accelerometer *; camera *; encrypted-media *; geolocation *; microphone *"
  style={{ width: "100%", height: 400 }}
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/new"
/>
```

---

## `Velite` Collections

For complex MDX systems, consider using:

- **[Velite](https://velite.js.org)** - Type-safe content system for Next.js
- **[Remark](https://npmjs.com/package/rehype-remark)** - Plugin that turn your HTML into Markdown

These tools let you:

- Query MDX content like a database
- Add custom rehype/remark plugins
- Automatically type MDX frontmatter and metadata

---

## Summary

MDX lets you write Markdown with embedded components, code highlighting, and React interactivity â€” all while maintaining readability and performance. Whether you're building a blog, docs site, or design system, MDX gives you the tools to scale content and code together.
