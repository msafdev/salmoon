## Intro

MDX combines Markdown and JSX, letting you embed interactive or styled content like music players, videos, or GitHub previews directly in your posts.

This shows a couple of `<iframe>` elements using custom components and tailwind classes.

## Apple Music

You can embed songs or albums from iMusic using `<iframe>` elements. These are fully responsive and preserve Apple's design principle.

- **Spotify Track**

<iframe
  allow="autoplay *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; picture-in-picture *"
  style={{ borderRadius: 12, border: 0, width: "100%", height: 152 }}
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5WOSNVChcadlsCRiqXE45K?utm_source=generator&theme=0"
  loading="lazy"
  allowFullScreen
/>

- **Spotify Album**

<iframe
  allow="autoplay *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; picture-in-picture *"
  style={{ borderRadius: 12, border: 0, width: "100%", height: 352 }}
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7Heaa0B4KOxdWhSICTR2wE?utm_source=generator"
  loading="lazy"
  allowFullScreen
/>

- **Apple Music**

<iframe
  allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write"
  style={{
    borderRadius: 4,
    border: 0,
    width: "100%",
    maxWidth: 660,
    height: 175,
    overflow: "hidden",
  }}
  loading="lazy"
  src="https://embed.music.apple.com/id/song/everything-u-are/1793295104"
/>

Keep in mind, `<iframe>` may behave inconsistently across browsers or themes, please use accordingly.

## YouTube

To embed a YouTube video, use a simple `<iframe>` with a fixed aspect-ratio and the video URL:

<iframe
  allowFullScreen
  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9, width: "100%", borderRadius: 4, border: 0 }}
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY"
  loading="lazy"
/>

You can adjust the width and height to match your layout needs.

## GitHub

For showcasing repositories, custom components can help you with that.

<GithubWidget repo="msafdev/salmoon" />

This component can be anything you want, a GitHub card, a file explorer, or live stats. Only limited by your capacity.
